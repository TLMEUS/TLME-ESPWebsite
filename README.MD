# TLME-ESP Website
This is the website used to manage the Extended Service Plans that are used by other projects, such as TLME-ESPAppIos and TLME-ESPAppAndroid. This site allows you to manage the plan categories, the plans themselves, and create an API key for th apps.

While I do write my software as a source of income, I feel I would not be here if it were not for all the software authors I have learned from over the years. So I am putting my completed projects here for others to learn from. Full ownership of the software contained in this and my other respositories is retained by myself. If you find something in my software you feel you could use, please email me at owner@troylmarkerenterpreises.com and we can discuss arrangements for your use of it.
